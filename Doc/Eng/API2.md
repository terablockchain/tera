# API v2 (for exchanges)
Works with update version 991

The API is designed to make it easier to write third-party applications. Server-side cryptography and POW operations are performed. Therefore, it is not recommended for public access, because it is not protected from DDOS attacks. Use it if applications such as the exchange server are on the same private network.

This API is available if fullnode server is running http and hosting included constant USE_HARD_API_V2.

### Set the constants (file const.lst):
```js
 "HTTP_HOSTING_PORT":80,
 "USE_HARD_API_V2":1,
```
After setting the constants, you need to restart the node.

Although the API is designed for use in POST requests, it can be used for GET requests in a limited mode.


Warning: the Tera blockchain has a high rate of block confirmation (starting from 8 seconds), but since it uses PoW, it is possible to get into local orphan chains. Therefore, for a reliable transfer of value, we recommend that exchanges wait for additional time, such as 100 seconds, to interpret the finality of the transaction.
In the method of sending transactions to the blockchain (Send,CreateAccount,SendRawTransaction) have a Confirm parameter which specifies the number of blocks-confirmations. The default value is 8. Attention: it is not recommended to set the value equal to zero, as in this case, the delivery transaction in the blockchain is not guaranteed.

Call format: 
```js
{{Server}}/api/v2/{{MethodName}}
```
Example:
```js
http://127.0.0.1/api/v2/GenerateKeys
```

As a result, JSON is returned, which contains the required result field with the value:
* 0 - the request contains errors or the result is not possible to get (for example, there is no such account), 
* 1 or >1 - successful execution of the query (in the case of requests of creating new accounts and Confirm the mode is not equal to zero returns the number of created accounts)

text - the optional field contains a detailed description of the result

All methods support the Meta parameter, if it is specified, the same value is added to the query result. This is useful for organizing your own query routing, often used in micro-service architectures.

## GenerateKeys

1)**/api/v2/GenerateKeys** - create private key - public key pair
