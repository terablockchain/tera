## Note:
* Constants are stored in JSON format
* In logical constants, such as enabling or disabling something, we recommend using the number 0 or 1
* Any constant can be changed from the command line as follows (run inside the ~/wallet/Source directory):
```
node set NAME=Value
```
* After changing the constants restart the node
