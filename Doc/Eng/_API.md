## API v1
Works with update version 1263

Official public gateways supporting this API:
* https://teraexplorer.org
* https://t1.teraexplorer.com
* https://t2.teraexplorer.com
* https://t4.teraexplorer.com
* https://t5.teraexplorer.com
* http://terablockchain.org
* http://dappsgate.com


This API is available if the fullnode is running public http-access. Set the constant HTTP_HOSTING_PORT

To do this, set the constants (from the full node interface or in the file: const.lst):
```js
"HTTP_HOSTING_PORT":80,
"USE_API_V1":1,
```
After setting the constants, you need to restart the node.


Although the API is designed for use in POST requests, it can be used for GET requests in a limited mode.

## SendHexTx

11)**/api/v1/SendHexTx**  - The transaction

To send a transaction, a number of processes must be performed on the client side:
1. To obtain the parameters of the user's account (OperationID)
2. Generate the transaction based on the account parameter (OperationID)
3. Sign transaction with private key
4. Convert the transaction in Hex format

If you have done all this, you can send the transaction command SendHexTx

P.S.
If this method is difficult for you, it is recommended to use API2, which is very easy to use.


Example:
```js
http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/SendHexTx?Hex=6F04FC0000000000BBE20200000001000000000009000000000000000000000001000000040054657374000000000000000012EB8196115106B9931E7D5BA05B6406E302F5A753378182BFF6F6BCE0407FAB56991286300BADDFF191B4A3722F1E9D10E70AE70476748840D6A24571382E1C
```
Result:
```
{"result":1,"text":"OK"}
```
Note: The transaction in hex format can be obtained if you use a functions from the js-library
* The library is located at: https://gitlab.com/terafoundation/tera/raw/master/Bin/Light/Tera-light.zip
* Example: http://dappsgate.com/_test-api.html



Note: for the correct operation of the examples, make sure that the OperationID is not lower than the current value in the user's account


12)**/GetSupply**  - returns a single number-the sum of the mined coins

Example (GET)

```
